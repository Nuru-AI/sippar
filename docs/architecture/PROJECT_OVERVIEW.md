# Sippar Project Overview - Architecture and Context

**Project**: Sippar - Algorand Chain Fusion Bridge  
**Date Created**: September 3, 2025  
**Last Updated**: September 4, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0-alpha  
**Status**: Sprint 008 Complete - AI Oracle Live  
**Purpose**: Project context, architecture overview, and development phases

## 🧠 **Project Context**

The Sippar project creates the first AI-enhanced trustless bridge between Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and Algorand using Chain Fusion technology. Named after the ancient Mesopotamian city that served as a bridge between civilizations, Sippar now bridges blockchain ecosystems through mathematical cryptography AND the world's first explainable AI oracle for smart contracts.

**Major Achievement**: Sprint 008 successfully delivered the first AI oracle for Algorand smart contracts, now live on testnet (App ID: 745336634) with full functionality verified.

### **Key Decisions Made**
1. **Sister Project Architecture**: Independent from Nuru AI with selective resource sharing
2. **AI-First Approach**: World's first explainable AI oracle with blockchain verification
3. **Technology Stack**: TypeScript/React frontend + PyTeal Algorand contracts + Chain Fusion backend
4. **Nuru AI Integration**: Leverage Three-Pillar Platform (Agent Forge, Lamassu Labs, Ziggurat Intelligence)
5. **Pattern Reuse**: Copy and adapt Rabbi patterns rather than shared libraries
6. **Enterprise Infrastructure**: Multi-region deployment with 99.9% SLA
