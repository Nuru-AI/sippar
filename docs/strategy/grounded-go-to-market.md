# Sippar Grounded Go-to-Market Strategy
## Evidence-Based Market Entry Plan

**Date**: September 22, 2025
**Version**: 1.0.0-factual
**Status**: Realistic GTM Framework
**Based on**: Actual technical capabilities and conservative market assumptions

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

### **Current Position**
Sippar is a functional ICP-Algorand Chain Fusion bridge with working threshold signatures, deployed at https://nuru.network/sippar/. The system enables custody-free cross-chain transactions between Internet Computer and Algorand ecosystems.

### **Market Opportunity**
Serve the niche intersection of ICP and Algorand developers (~14K total developers) who need cross-chain functionality without traditional bridge custody risks. Focus on technical excellence in a small but underserved market.

### **Go-to-Market Approach**
Developer-first strategy targeting early adopters in both ecosystems through technical content, partnerships, and hands-on support rather than broad marketing campaigns.
