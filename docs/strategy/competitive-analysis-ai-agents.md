## üéØ **Executive Summary**

### **Competitive Landscape Overview**
The AI agent payment infrastructure market is rapidly forming with well-funded competitors including Skyfire ($14.5M), Google's AP2 protocol (60+ partners), and Circle's USDC integration. However, these solutions rely on economic security models that create unacceptable custody risks for enterprise autonomous agent deployment.

### **Sippar's Strategic Advantage**
Sippar's mathematical security through threshold signatures eliminates custody risks entirely, addressing the #1 barrier to enterprise autonomous agent adoption. While competitors focus on consumer and developer markets, Sippar targets the higher-value enterprise segment requiring mathematical guarantees for custody-free autonomous transactions.

### **Market Timing**
With 25% of gen AI companies launching agentic pilots in 2025 and BFSI sector leading adoption ($87B API value), the market is forming now. Sippar's production-ready system (71 APIs) provides first-mover advantage while competitors develop emerging standards.
