## ðŸŽ¯ **Strategic Positioning Framework**

### **Core Philosophy: Technology Before Blockchain**

Traditional blockchain investment presentations lead with ecosystem names (ICP, Algorand) assuming investor knowledge. This creates immediate barriers for non-crypto investors and obscures the fundamental technology advantages.

**Sippar's Approach**: Lead with universal technology concepts, then progressively disclose how specific blockchain implementations enable these capabilities.

### **Target Audience Segmentation**

**Primary Audience**: Early-stage and growth investors (blockchain-agnostic)
- Traditional VCs exploring Web3 opportunities
- AI-focused investment funds
- Enterprise technology investors
- Strategic corporate investors

**Secondary Audience**: Blockchain-native investors
- Crypto VCs familiar with ICP/Algorand ecosystems
- DeFi protocol investors
- Infrastructure-focused blockchain funds
