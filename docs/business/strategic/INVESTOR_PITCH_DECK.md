## üìã **Slide-by-Slide Content**

### **Slide 1: Title & Opening Hook**
**Visual**: Clean logo, professional team photo, key metrics overlay
**Content**:
- **Company**: Sippar - Universal Payment Bridge for AI Agent Ecosystems
- **Tagline**: "Be the Bridge, Not the Builder. The Agents Already Exist."
- **Key Metric**: "Revenue starting Week 2 from cross-platform transaction fees"
- **Status**: "6-week deployment connecting ELNA.ai, x402 Bazaar, Google AP2"
- **Demo**: "Live integration-ready technology at https://nuru.network/sippar/"

### **Slide 2: The Problem - Autonomous AI Commerce Barriers**
**Visual**: Split screen showing current limitations vs. autonomous AI requirements
**Content**:
- **The Reality**: AI agent platforms like ELNA.ai, x402 Bazaar, Google AP2 exist but operate in isolation
- **Current Barriers**:
  - Agents trapped in platform silos without cross-ecosystem connectivity
  - No universal payment infrastructure for cross-platform transactions
  - Platforms building separate payment systems instead of connecting
  - Users limited to single-platform agent services instead of best-of-breed

**Speaker Notes**: "The agents already exist and work well - they just can't pay each other across platforms. We're solving connection, not creation."

---

### **Slide 3: Market Opportunity - AI Agent Platform Connectivity**
**Visual**: Platform ecosystem map showing isolated platforms and universal bridge connection
**Content**:
