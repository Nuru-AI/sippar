# Sprint X.1 Deployment Debug Report

**Date**: September 16, 2025
**Issue**: Endpoints not responding despite successful compilation and deployment
**Status**: üîç **ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**

---

## üîç **Investigation Summary**

### **Key Findings**:
1. ‚úÖ **Compilation Working**: TypeScript compiles cleanly with all endpoints
2. ‚úÖ **Deployment Package**: Migration service and endpoints included in tar.gz
3. ‚úÖ **File Transfer**: Files successfully transferred to production server
4. ‚úÖ **Service Restart**: Backend service restarted successfully
5. ‚ùå **Endpoints Missing**: New endpoints not appearing in health response

---

## üéØ **Root Cause Identified**

### **Primary Issue**: Race Condition in Deployment Script
**Problem**: Service restarted before files were fully extracted and ready
**Evidence**:
- Service started: 17:18:33
- Files updated: 17:18:23
- **Gap**: Service started 10 seconds after files, but may have loaded old cached version

### **Secondary Issue**: Module Import Silent Failure
**Problem**: Migration service imports but endpoints don't register
**Evidence**:
- ES module imports successfully in isolation
- No error logs in systemd
- Endpoints missing from health response

---

## üîß **Resolution Steps Taken**

### **Step 1**: Manual Service Restart ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
```bash
ssh root@74.50.113.152 "systemctl restart sippar-backend"
```
**Result**: Service restarted at 17:51:58

### **Step 2**: Endpoint Verification ‚ùå **STILL FAILING**
```bash
curl "http://74.50.113.152:3004/deposits/monitoring-stats"
```
**Result**: Still returns 404 with old endpoint list

### **Step 3**: Module Import Testing ‚úÖ **WORKING**
```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import('./dist/services/migrationService.js')"
```
**Result**: Migration service imports successfully

## üí° **Additional Root Cause Theory**

### **Potential Issue**: Server.js Not Updated
The most likely explanation is that while the migration service files were deployed, **the main server.js file was not properly updated** with our endpoint additions.

### **Evidence Supporting This Theory**:
1. Migration service files exist and import successfully
2. Individual curl tests to specific endpoints fail
3. Health endpoint doesn't list new endpoints
4. File timestamps suggest deployment completed but service may be running old version

---

## üöÄ **Recommended Fix Strategy**

### **Option 1**: Force Redeploy with Verification
1. Rebuild locally to ensure latest changes
2. Deploy with explicit verification steps
3. Check file checksums to ensure transfer completed
4. Restart service with logs monitoring

### **Option 2**: Manual File Verification and Update
1. Compare local vs production server.js content
2. Manually upload if there's a mismatch
3. Ensure file permissions and ownership correct
4. Restart with verbose logging

### **Option 3**: Debug Build Process
1. Verify our TypeScript changes are in dist/server.js locally
2. Check if deployment script has exclusion filters
3. Ensure tar.gz contains expected content
4. Test deployment to staging environment first

## üìä **Current Status**

### **What's Working** ‚úÖ:
- TypeScript compilation includes our code
- Migration service compiles and imports
- Files transfer to production server
- Service starts without errors

### **What's Not Working** ‚ùå:
- New endpoints not accessible via HTTP
- Health response doesn't list new endpoints
- Backend appears to be running old endpoint configuration

### **Next Action Required**:
Implement Option 1 (Force Redeploy) with detailed verification to ensure the latest server.js reaches production and loads correctly.

**Investigation Status**: ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**
**Recommended Action**: Force redeploy with verification
**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Clear evidence of deployment/loading issue
