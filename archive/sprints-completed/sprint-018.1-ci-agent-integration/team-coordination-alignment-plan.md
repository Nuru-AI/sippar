---

## üéØ **RESOLUTION STRATEGY**

### **Immediate Actions** *(Today - September 29)*

#### **1. Status Communication** *(Priority: CRITICAL)*
**Send to CI Teams**:
```
URGENT STATUS UPDATE: Sippar Sprint 018.1 Already Operational

Current Status:
‚úÖ CI Agent marketplace already deployed and functional
‚úÖ 5 agents operational: Athena, Architect, Developer, Auditor, Analyst
‚úÖ X402 payment processing working with transaction fees
‚úÖ Backend integration complete with quality scoring system
‚úÖ Production deployment at https://nuru.network/sippar/

Integration Need:
- Enhance existing system vs build new infrastructure
- Add your performance optimizations and monitoring
- Expand from 5 agents to your full catalog
- Integrate your quality assessment improvements

Next Step: Coordinate enhancement approach rather than clean slate deployment
```

#### **2. Agent Selection Resolution** *(Priority: HIGH)*
**User Decision Required**:
- **Core Free Agents**: Which agents should be free tier?
- **Premium Paid Agents**: Which agents require payment?
- **Enterprise Agents**: Which agents are enterprise-only?
- **Integration Priority**: Which agents to enhance first?

**Current Operational Agents**:
- Athena (Memory & Learning Systems)
- Architect (System Design)
- Developer (Core Development)
- Auditor (Accuracy Validation)
- Analyst (Data Analysis)

#### **3. API Reconciliation** *(Priority: HIGH)*
**Current Operational Endpoints**:
```
POST /api/sippar/ci-agents/:agent/:service
GET  /api/sippar/ci-agents/status
GET  /api/sippar/ci-agents/capabilities
POST /api/sippar/x402/payment/:service
GET  /api/sippar/x402/analytics
```

**Proposed CI Endpoints**:
```
POST /api/v1/agents/invoke
GET  /api/v1/agents/status/{id}
GET  /api/v1/agents/capabilities/{agent}
GET  /health
GET  /metrics/agents
```

**Resolution**: Map CI endpoints to enhance existing operational endpoints
