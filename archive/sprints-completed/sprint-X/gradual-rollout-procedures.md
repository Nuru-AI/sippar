# Sprint X Phase 4.2: Gradual Rollout Procedures

**Date**: September 15, 2025
**Phase**: Sprint X Week 4 Phase 4.2 - User Migration & Testing
**Status**: ðŸš€ **IMPLEMENTATION READY** - Gradual rollout strategy for production migration
**Dependencies**: Migration Strategy Complete, Testing Framework Ready

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **GRADUAL ROLLOUT STRATEGY**

### **Rollout Philosophy**: **"Safe, Monitored, Reversible"**

Every rollout stage includes:
- **Limited User Cohorts**: Small, controllable user groups
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerts
- **Immediate Rollback**: Ability to pause/revert at any stage
- **Success Validation**: Clear go/no-go criteria for next stage

### **Rollout Stages Overview**:

1. **Stage 0**: Internal Team Testing (0 external users)
2. **Stage 1**: Alpha Testing (5 trusted users)
3. **Stage 2**: Beta Testing (25 early adopters)
4. **Stage 3**: Limited Release (100 users, 10% of base)
5. **Stage 4**: Expanded Release (500 users, 50% of base)
6. **Stage 5**: Full Production (All users)
