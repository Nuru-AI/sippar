## 🛠️ **Technical Foundation**

### **Current Capabilities**
```typescript
// Live production system - this actually works!
import { X402Client } from '@sippar/x402-sdk';

const client = new X402Client({
  principal: 'your-icp-principal',
  algorandAddress: 'your-algorand-address'
});

// Create payment (works in production)
const payment = await client.createPayment({
  service: 'ai-oracle-enhanced',
  amount: 0.05
});

// Use AI service (functional)
const response = await client.queryAI({
  query: 'Your question here',
  model: 'deepseek-r1'
}, payment.serviceToken);
```

### **Architecture Highlights**
- **Chain Fusion**: ICP threshold signatures + Algorand settlement
- **Security**: Multi-layer validation, rate limiting, audit logging
- **Performance**: 0.88ms average payment processing time
- **Scalability**: 12 services across 5 categories ready for growth
